# perforce
Drupal Code Challenge


Here is my drupal code challenge.

I used a stock theme called adaptive themes which I then created a sub theme called perforce.

I created this site on pantheon dev server.

It is an running on php version 7.2 and drupal 8.6.10 which was the most recent version at the time of completion. 

Its mostly a pretty stock version of Drupal with just a few modules added to help with some styling stuff like the font awesome modules I used for the social media and search icons. On the site I made all of the links just go to # for the time being. I thought it might be weird to link up to the existing Perforce site. Also I added some custom styles to the custom stylesheet as well as a generic bootstrap.css to the custom stylesheet as well to help with responsiveness of the site.

The site should load up properly as I ran some tests and everything seems to work. I will also include a link here to review it where it is currently residing. http://dev-perforce-tom-site.pantheonsite.io/

I will send over admin credientials in the email.

Thank you so much for this opportunity!
